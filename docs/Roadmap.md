# PMQA Roadmap

This document is the authoritative project status and phase roadmap. Product
purpose belongs in [Vision](Vision.md); implementation boundaries belong in
[Architecture](architecture.md).

## Status

| Phase | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Foundation and architecture | Complete | Established the reusable framework layout, core knowledge models, provider contracts, product-pack boundary, and initial graph skeleton. |
| Task 2 — SauceDemo vertical slice | Complete | Added bounded Playwright exploration, persisted product knowledge, and deterministic artifact-driven test generation. |
| Task 3 — Reasoning trust boundary | Complete | Added provider-independent reasoning contracts, scrubbing, deterministic/manual/Copilot CLI providers, prompt packages, and SQLite trace storage. |
| Task 4 — Multi-agent runtime | Complete | Added typed state, agent and tool contracts, deterministic reduction and routing, runtime execution, validated recovery, and LangGraph assembly. |
| Task 4.8 — Closure cleanup | Ready for review | Consolidates prohibited-key policy and retires the misleading Task 1 graph entry point before Task 5. |
| Task 5 | Not started | Next approved phase; implementation scope will be defined before work begins. |

## Task 4 closure

Task 4 delivered:

- immutable, JSON-compatible workflow-state contracts;
- typed agent contracts and constrained state updates;
- typed tool contracts and deterministic tool registration;
- a deterministic workflow-state reducer;
- a validated one-agent runtime pipeline;
- deterministic supervisor policy;
- failed-validation recovery routing;
- complete validation-history correlation;
- thin LangGraph workflow assembly; and
- final allowed-cycle max-iteration semantics.

The Task 4 implementation checkpoint is
`86214d76d2f12a2b70793b6ca28da4e1e5f3d858`, incorporating PRs #15 and #16.
The documentation-only Task 4 closure commit follows that checkpoint.

Task 4.8 is a narrow closure cleanup. It centralizes the common prohibited-key
policy at a neutral dependency layer, preserves explicit workflow-only runtime
restrictions, and retires the disconnected Task 1 no-op graph and executable
entry point. It does not add agents, tools, or Task 5 behavior.

## Next phase

Task 5 is not started. Its branch should be based on `main` only after Task 4.8
passes review and is merged. No Task 5 implementation details are committed by
this cleanup.
